Version 0.5::

Initial reworking from the old packagetrack package, which has become
abandonware.

New features:
    
* Full Python2.6 -> 3.6 support using modern libraries (six, requests, etc)
* Split up tests
* Main interface is now a class rather than using module-based state
* Using JSON interfaces when possible, rather than XML
* Much cleanup
